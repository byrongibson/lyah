Code from *Learn You a Haskell For Great Good*.  Not all code in the book, just particularly interesting stuff or something I didn't understand and needed to see it in action to grok.

PS - Miran, the author, is superb at explaining technical concepts.  Highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn Haskell or functional programming in general.
